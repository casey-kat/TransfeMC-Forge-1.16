# TransfeMC
A Minecraft 1.16.5 modpack for Forge.

## Ideas and Goals and TODO
### Crafting
- easy block conversions (furniture, stairs, slabs, etc, all easily turned into and back from their respective blocks through the stone cutter)
- blocks converted using workstations, like smithing table and stone cutter, have no crafting table recipe counterpart
- change furnace functionality, make blast furnace a requirement for smelting
- better dye functionality, easily remove/change dyes
### Equipment
- remove diamond equipment, consider removing wood/stone equipment
- fix tool progression using the new metals and alloys
- remove tool durability, supplement with new tool progression
- make tools require spartan weaponry handles to craft, and otherwise incorporate spartan equipment
### Mobs
- hostile mobs (besides slime) do not spawn above light level 0
- removed baby zombies lol
- creeper explosions are not permanent, repair after a time (might remove, kinda meh)
### Mining
- unified block mining speed, somehow
- 'divergent underground' functionality (mining stone or ore drops an item for flexibility, as opposed to a block)
- mining with dynamite is possible and encouraged, mass mining good with minecarts
### Magic
- potions are weird, idk, theyre probably fine. see if that mod with the vials exists
- vague feelings about enchantments, figure out how to handle them after everything else. maybe remove the enchanting table, make enchanted books craftable, who knows
### Transport
- minecarts/rails improved upon, and somewhat focused around
- SOMEHOW remove ability to sit in a minecart, replaced with minecart chest & pushcarts (might not be compatible with create cart machines, but may remove them anyway)
- carry entities and tile entities (remember to remove carrying for several incompatible tile entities. alternatively, use the packing tape mod for tile entities)
### Other Mechanics
- modified stack sizes (either generally larger, or generally smaller) (some stacks larger than 64? - check mod compatibility)
- fluids have simple physics, water cannot be duplicated, lava can not have blocks placed inside of it
